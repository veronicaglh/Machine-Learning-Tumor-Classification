# The dataset used for this program can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
# Users can use the input given by the dataset and submit it into the entry field of the GUI. 

# The code for this project has been classified into two parts 
# The first part will be dealing with building the GUI(graphical user interface) - using tkinter

# This program uses various python libraries to work 
# Inorder to access the libraries they must first be installed using the following commands:
